# TileEditorPro
TileEditorPro allows for editing CHR data, ROM files, and Palette data on macOS. At the moment TileEditorPro only supports the Nintendo (NES) console.

This project was written in Swift 4 and depends on the TileEditor.framework which allows for modularization of code.


## Common Questions
### What is CHR data?
CHR data is the format which the console understands to display.

### What is a ROM file?
A ROM file is the game which is either downloaded from the internet or ripped from a cartridge you own.

Do not ask me where you may download a ROM file.

### What is Palette data?
Palette data is the binary format for colors which the console understands. By exporting the palette data allows you as the game developer to include the palette data into your game during compile time.

### Which license is the program under?
